# Lesson plan

In this final project, students will be challenged to use what they've learned to  a game of their choice! You may choose to assign a theme that applies to current events or a topic they are studying at the time. Students can elaborate on any of their previous projects or any examples on the [kaboomjs.com website](https://kaboomjs.com/play?demo=sprite). 

**Be sure to add any requirements or constraints for your students to the `instructions.md` file!**

Celebrate by playing each others games and having fun!
